### New Command Workflow
The updated story structure creates a logical user workflow:

1. **`list-sets`** - Discover available template sets in directory
2. **`discover`** - Find templates within a specific set  
3. **`scan`** - Identify placeholders in templates
4. **`copy`** - Copy template set to working directory
5. **`replace`** - Replace placeholders with values

**Example:**
```bash
# Step 1: See what's available
docx-template list-sets --templates /shared/templates

# Step 2: Explore a specific set
docx-template discover --templates /shared/templates --set Contract_Templates

# Step 3: Find placeholders
docx-template scan --templates /shared/templates --set Contract_Templates

# Step 4: Copy and work with templates
docx-template copy --templates /shared/templates --set Contract_Templates --target ./work
docx-template replace --folder ./work/Contract_Templates_timestamp --map values.json
```

**Requirements**:
- Increase unit test coverage from current 46.6% to 90%
- Add missing test scenarios for uncovered code paths
- Implement comprehensive edge case testing
- Add integration tests for complex service interactions
- Create performance and stress testing scenarios

**Implementation Notes**:
- Current status: 268 tests passing, 46.6% coverage
- Need to add approximately 400-500 additional test cases
- Focus on Core services, Infrastructure layer, and CLI commands
- Requires comprehensive mocking strategy for external dependencies
- Should integrate with existing CI/CD pipeline for coverage validation

**Dependencies**:
- Requires completion of Story 04.001 (basic testing infrastructure)
