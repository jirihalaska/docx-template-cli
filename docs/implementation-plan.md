## Risk Mitigation Plan

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|------------|-------------|
| OpenXml complexity | Early prototype, reference existing code | Use alternative library |
| Pipeline complexity | Start simple, iterate | Provide batch scripts |
| Performance issues | Continuous benchmarking | Optimize in week 4 |
| Czech encoding | Test early and often | Implement fallbacks |

### Schedule Risks
| Risk | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|------------|-------------|
| Scope creep | Strict phase boundaries | Defer to v2.1 |
| Testing delays | Parallel test development | Reduce coverage target |
| Documentation lag | Document as you code | Simplified docs for v2.0 |
