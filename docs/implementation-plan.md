# Implementation Plan
**DOCX Template CLI System v2.0**  
*BMad-Compliant Implementation Roadmap*  
*Created: 2025-08-17*

---

## Implementation Overview

4-week sprint plan to deliver a production-ready CLI system with complete test coverage and documentation.

### Sprint Timeline
- **Week 1**: Foundation & Core Services
- **Week 2**: CLI Commands & Basic Operations  
- **Week 3**: Advanced Features & Error Handling
- **Week 4**: Testing, Documentation & Release

### Story Implementation Order
**Foundation (Week 1):**
- 01.001: Project Setup & Architecture ✅
- 01.002: Core Models & Interfaces ✅
- 01.003: Infrastructure Foundation ✅

**CLI Commands (Week 2):**
- 02.001: List Sets Command (NEW - discover template sets)
- 02.002: Discover Command (find templates within sets)
- 02.003: Scan Command (find placeholders)
- 02.004: Copy Command (copy template sets)

**Advanced Features (Week 3):**
- 03.001: Replace Command implementation
- 03.003: Error handling and recovery

**Testing & Release (Week 4):**
- 04.001: Unit & Cross-Platform Testing
- 04.002: End-to-End Testing
- 04.003: Documentation
- 04.004: Performance Optimization
- 04.005: Release Preparation

### New Command Workflow
The updated story structure creates a logical user workflow:

1. **`list-sets`** - Discover available template sets in directory
2. **`discover`** - Find templates within a specific set  
3. **`scan`** - Identify placeholders in templates
4. **`copy`** - Copy template set to working directory
5. **`replace`** - Replace placeholders with values

**Example:**
```bash
# Step 1: See what's available
docx-template list-sets --templates /shared/templates

# Step 2: Explore a specific set
docx-template discover --templates /shared/templates --set Contract_Templates

# Step 3: Find placeholders
docx-template scan --templates /shared/templates --set Contract_Templates

# Step 4: Copy and work with templates
docx-template copy --templates /shared/templates --set Contract_Templates --target ./work
docx-template replace --folder ./work/Contract_Templates_timestamp --map values.json
```

## Risk Mitigation Plan

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|------------|-------------|
| OpenXml complexity | Early prototype, reference existing code | Use alternative library |
| Performance issues | Continuous benchmarking | Optimize in week 4 |
| Czech encoding | Test early and often | Implement fallbacks |
| Error handling complexity | Start with basic scenarios, iterate | Simplify for v2.0 |

### Schedule Risks
| Risk | Mitigation | Contingency |
