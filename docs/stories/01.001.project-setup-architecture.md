**Story ID:** 01.001  
**Epic:** Foundation & Core Services  
**Created:** 2025-08-17  
**Status:** Ready

---

## Story

**As a** development team,  
**I want** to establish a complete project foundation with proper architecture, build system, and CI/CD pipeline,  
**so that** we can develop the DOCX Template CLI system efficiently with consistent code quality, automated testing, and reliable deployment processes.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Repository and Project Structure
- **GIVEN** a new development project
- **WHEN** the repository is initialized
- **THEN** the following structure is created:
  - Git repository with appropriate .gitignore for .NET projects
  - Solution file with clean architecture project structure (CLI, Core, Infrastructure, Tests)
  - EditorConfig and analyzer configurations for consistent code style
  - Initial README with build and setup instructions

### AC2: Package Dependencies
- **GIVEN** the project structure is in place
- **WHEN** NuGet packages are configured
- **THEN** the following packages are added with appropriate versions:
  - DocumentFormat.OpenXml (3.0.0) for Word document processing
  - System.CommandLine (2.0.0-beta) for CLI framework
  - xUnit (2.6) for unit testing framework
  - Moq (4.20) and FluentAssertions (6.12) for testing utilities
  - BenchmarkDotNet (0.13) for performance testing

### AC3: CI/CD Pipeline
- **GIVEN** the repository structure and dependencies are configured
- **WHEN** GitHub Actions workflow is set up
- **THEN** the pipeline includes:
  - Build verification on Windows, macOS, and Linux
  - Unit test execution with coverage reporting
  - Code quality analysis with SonarQube integration
  - Automated security scanning
  - Package creation for successful builds

### AC4: Development Documentation
- **GIVEN** the project foundation is complete
- **WHEN** documentation is created
- **THEN** the following files exist and are accurate:
  - README.md with clear build instructions
  - CONTRIBUTING.md with development guidelines
  - API documentation structure with DocFX configuration
  - Architecture decision records (ADR) template

### AC5: Build and Test Verification
- **GIVEN** all setup is complete
- **WHEN** the build process is executed
- **THEN** the following criteria are met:
  - Solution builds successfully on all target platforms
  - Unit test framework is functional with sample tests
  - Code coverage reporting generates successfully
  - Static analysis tools run without critical issues
  - All GitHub Actions workflows pass

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Git repository initialized with clean history
- [ ] Solution structure follows clean architecture principles
- [ ] All required NuGet packages installed and configured
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline running successfully
- [ ] Code quality tools (analyzers, SonarQube) integrated
- [ ] README documentation complete with build instructions
- [ ] Sample unit tests demonstrate testing framework functionality
- [ ] Build succeeds on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- [ ] Code coverage baseline established (>80% target)
- [ ] All team members can successfully clone and build locally

---

## Assumptions

1. **Development Environment**: Team has access to Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code with .NET 8.0 SDK
2. **GitHub Access**: Repository will be hosted on GitHub with Actions enabled
3. **NuGet Packages**: All required packages are available and compatible with .NET 8.0
4. **Cross-Platform**: Build must support Windows 10+, macOS 11+, Ubuntu 20.04+
5. **SonarQube**: Organization has SonarQube instance or uses SonarCloud
6. **Package Management**: Team follows semantic versioning for internal packages
7. **Code Style**: Microsoft coding conventions will be enforced
8. **Security**: Standard security scanning tools are sufficient for this phase

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- GitHub repository creation and permissions
- SonarQube/SonarCloud account setup
- .NET 8.0 SDK availability on all development machines

### Internal Dependencies
- Architecture decisions documented in ADR format
- Team agreement on coding standards and practices
- Development environment standardization

### Blocking Dependencies
- None identified for this foundational story

---

## Notes

### Technical Considerations
- Clean Architecture requires careful dependency management between layers
- System.CommandLine is in beta but Microsoft-supported and stable
- OpenXML package has breaking changes from v2 to v3 - ensure compatibility
- GitHub Actions has usage limits for private repositories

### Risk Mitigation
- Use preview packages only where necessary and well-tested
- Implement comprehensive integration tests for CI/CD pipeline
- Document all environment-specific configurations
- Create rollback procedures for failed deployments

### Future Enhancements
- Consider adding Docker containerization for consistent builds
- Evaluate GitHub Codespaces for cloud development environments
- Plan for automated dependency updates with Dependabot
- Consider adding performance benchmarking to CI pipeline

## Effort Estimate

**Total Effort**: 16 hours

**Breakdown by Role**:
- DevLead: 5 hours (Repository setup, code quality tools)
- Developer: 5 hours (Packages, documentation, testing)
- DevOps: 4 hours (CI/CD pipeline configuration)
- QA: 2 hours (Build verification and validation)
