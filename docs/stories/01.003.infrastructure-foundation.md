**Story ID:** 01.003  
**Epic:** Foundation & Core Services  
**Created:** 2025-08-17  
**Status:** Ready

---

## Story

**As a** development team,  
**I want** to establish a robust infrastructure layer with file system abstraction, logging, configuration management, and dependency injection,  
**so that** we have reliable, testable, and maintainable infrastructure services that support all I/O operations, error tracking, and application lifecycle management.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: File System Service Implementation
- **GIVEN** the core models and interfaces are defined
- **WHEN** file system operations are implemented
- **THEN** the following functionality is available:
  - `IFileSystemService` abstraction for all file operations
  - File and directory existence checking with proper error handling
  - Safe file reading/writing with encoding support (UTF-8, Czech characters)
  - Directory traversal with filtering and recursive options
  - Atomic file operations with backup and rollback capabilities

### AC2: Logging Infrastructure
- **GIVEN** the file system service is implemented
- **WHEN** logging infrastructure is configured
- **THEN** the following logging capabilities exist:
  - Structured logging with correlation IDs for operation tracking
  - Multiple log levels (Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Critical)
  - File-based logging with rotation and retention policies
  - Console logging with colored output for development
  - Performance logging for operation timing and metrics

### AC3: Configuration Management
- **GIVEN** logging infrastructure is in place
- **WHEN** configuration management is implemented
- **THEN** the following configuration sources are supported:
  - appsettings.json with environment-specific overrides
  - Environment variables with prefix-based organization
  - Command-line argument integration with System.CommandLine
  - Configuration validation with schema enforcement
  - Hot-reload capability for development scenarios

### AC4: Retry Policy Implementation
- **GIVEN** configuration management is working
- **WHEN** retry policies are implemented
- **THEN** the following resilience patterns are available:
  - Exponential backoff for file I/O operations
  - Circuit breaker pattern for external service calls
  - Timeout handling with configurable thresholds
  - Retry count limits with failure escalation
  - Detailed retry attempt logging for troubleshooting

### AC5: Dependency Injection Container
- **GIVEN** all infrastructure services are implemented
- **WHEN** dependency injection is configured
- **THEN** the following DI capabilities exist:
  - Service container setup with lifetime management
  - Interface-to-implementation registration for all services
  - Configuration injection for service configuration
  - Scoped service management for operation contexts
  - Service validation during startup with clear error messages

### AC6: Infrastructure Unit Tests
- **GIVEN** all infrastructure components are implemented
- **WHEN** unit tests are executed
- **THEN** the following test coverage is achieved:
  - File system service mocked and tested in isolation
  - Logging infrastructure tested with different appenders
  - Configuration loading tested with various sources
  - Retry policies tested with failure simulation
  - Dependency injection container tested for proper registration

## Definition of Done

- [ ] IFileSystemService interface and implementation complete
- [ ] Logging infrastructure configured with multiple outputs
- [ ] Configuration management supports all required sources
- [ ] Retry policies implemented with proper error handling
- [ ] Dependency injection container configured and tested
- [ ] Unit tests achieve >90% coverage for infrastructure layer
- [ ] All tests pass on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established for file operations
- [ ] Documentation complete with configuration examples
- [ ] Static analysis passes with no critical issues

---

## Assumptions

1. **File System**: Standard file system APIs are sufficient for all operations
2. **Logging Framework**: Microsoft.Extensions.Logging provides adequate functionality
3. **Configuration**: .NET configuration system meets all requirements
4. **Retry Logic**: Simple retry policies are sufficient for initial version
5. **DI Container**: Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection is adequate
6. **Cross-Platform**: All infrastructure works consistently across target platforms
7. **Performance**: File operations performance is acceptable for CLI usage
8. **Security**: Standard file permissions and access controls are sufficient

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Microsoft.Extensions.Logging for logging infrastructure
- Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration for configuration management
- Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection for IoC container
- Polly library for retry policies and resilience patterns

### Internal Dependencies
- Core models and interfaces from Story 01.002 must be complete
- Project foundation from Story 01.001 must be operational
- Unit testing framework must be configured and working

### Blocking Dependencies
- Story 01.002 completion (interfaces are required for DI registration)

---

## Notes

### Technical Considerations
- File system abstraction enables comprehensive unit testing
- Structured logging with correlation IDs aids in debugging complex operations
- Configuration hot-reload improves development experience
- Retry policies should be configurable for different environments
- DI container scope management is critical for resource cleanup

### Risk Mitigation
- Abstract all external dependencies for testability
- Implement comprehensive error handling for I/O operations
- Use proven libraries (Polly) for complex resilience patterns
- Create integration tests for cross-platform file operations
- Document configuration schema and validation rules

### Future Enhancements
- Add distributed logging capabilities for future scaling
- Consider adding caching layer for frequently accessed files
- Plan for async/await patterns in all I/O operations
- Evaluate need for background service hosting capabilities
- Consider adding health check endpoints for monitoring

## Effort Estimate

**Total Effort**: 20 hours

**Breakdown by Role**:
- Senior Developer: 6 hours (File system, DI container, guidance)
- Developer: 9 hours (Configuration, retry policies, tests)
- DevOps: 3 hours (Logging infrastructure, deployment considerations)
- QA: 2 hours (Test scenarios, cross-platform validation)

**Contingency Buffer**: +20% (4 hours) for cross-platform compatibility issues

## Priority

**MoSCoW**: Must Have  
**Business Priority**: Critical  
**Technical Priority**: Foundational

**Rationale**: Infrastructure services are essential for all application operations. Without proper file system abstraction, logging, and configuration management, the application cannot operate reliably in production environments.
