**Story ID:** 02.002  
**Epic:** CLI Commands & Basic Operations  
**Created:** 2025-08-17  
**Status:** Done

## Story

**As a** template administrator,  
**I want** a CLI command to discover all DOCX template files in a directory tree,  
**so that** I can quickly identify and catalog all available templates in my organization's file systems with comprehensive metadata and flexible output formats.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Basic Template Discovery
- **GIVEN** a directory path is specified
- **WHEN** the discover command is executed
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Recursively scan the directory for .docx files
  - Exclude temporary files (~$*.docx) and hidden files
  - Return metadata for each discovered template (path, size, modified date)
  - Handle permission errors gracefully without stopping the scan

### AC2: Recursive Directory Scanning
- **GIVEN** a directory structure with nested subdirectories
- **WHEN** the discover command runs with recursive mode
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Scan all subdirectories to unlimited depth by default
  - Provide option to limit scanning depth (--max-depth parameter)
  - Follow symbolic links with cycle detection
  - Skip directories without read permissions and log warnings

### AC3: Output Format Options
- **GIVEN** templates are discovered successfully
- **WHEN** different output formats are requested
- **THEN** the system should support:
  - JSON format with structured metadata (--format json)
  - Human-readable text format (--format text) as default
  - Table format with columns (--format table)
  - CSV format for data import (--format csv)
  - All formats include: file path, size, last modified, creation date

### AC4: Progress Reporting
- **GIVEN** a large directory tree is being scanned
- **WHEN** the discover command is running
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Display progress indicator showing current directory being scanned
  - Show count of files processed and templates found
  - Provide estimated time remaining for large scans
  - Allow progress reporting to be disabled with --quiet flag

### AC5: Filtering and Options
- **GIVEN** various filtering requirements
- **WHEN** discover command options are used
- **THEN** the system should support:
  - Pattern matching for file names (--include, --exclude patterns)
  - Size filtering (--min-size, --max-size)
  - Date filtering (--modified-after, --modified-before)
  - Case-insensitive pattern matching option
  - Dry-run mode to show what would be discovered

## Assumptions

1. **File System Access**: User has read permissions for target directories
2. **DOCX Format**: Only .docx files are considered templates (not .doc or .docm)
3. **Memory Usage**: Directory scanning results fit in available memory
4. **Performance**: Scanning 10,000+ files should complete within reasonable time
5. **Network Drives**: Command supports local and network-mounted directories
6. **Unicode Support**: File paths with international characters are handled correctly
7. **Concurrent Access**: Other processes may modify directory during scanning
8. **Symlinks**: System follows symbolic links but detects cycles

---

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- System.CommandLine framework for command parsing
- .NET file system APIs for directory traversal
- DocumentFormat.OpenXml for basic file validation

### Internal Dependencies
- Core.Models.TemplateFile domain model
- Core.Services.ITemplateDiscoveryService interface
- Infrastructure file system abstraction layer

### Blocking Dependencies
- Story 01.003 (Infrastructure Foundation) must be completed
- Core domain models must be defined and stable

---

## Notes

### Technical Considerations
- Large directory trees may require streaming results rather than loading all in memory
- File system watchers could be used for real-time discovery in future iterations
- Symbolic link handling varies between operating systems
- Network drive scanning may be slower and require timeout handling

### Risk Mitigation
- Implement cancellation token support for long-running scans
- Use lazy enumeration to handle large result sets
- Add comprehensive logging for troubleshooting file system issues
- Implement retry logic for transient file system errors

### Future Enhancements
- Watch mode for real-time template discovery
- Integration with cloud storage providers (SharePoint, OneDrive)
- Template validation during discovery
- Duplicate detection based on file content hash

## Effort Estimate

**Total Effort**: 24 hours

**Breakdown by Role**:
- Backend Developer: 10 hours (Service implementation, formatters)
- CLI Developer: 4 hours (Command interface)
- QA Engineer: 4 hours (Integration testing)
- UI Developer: 3 hours (Progress reporting)
- Performance Engineer: 3 hours (Optimization and benchmarks)

**Contingency Buffer**: +25% (6 hours) for file system complexity and cross-platform issues

---

## Priority

**MoSCoW**: Must Have  
**Business Priority**: High  
**Technical Priority**: Critical

**Rationale**: Template discovery is a foundational capability required for all other CLI operations. Without reliable discovery, users cannot effectively work with their template collections.
