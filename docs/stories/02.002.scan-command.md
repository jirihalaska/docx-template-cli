# User Story: Scan Command Implementation

**Story ID:** 02.002  
**Epic:** CLI Commands & Basic Operations  
**Created:** 2025-08-17  
**Status:** Draft

---

## Story

**As a** template developer,  
**I want** a CLI command to scan DOCX templates and identify all placeholders within them,  
**so that** I can understand what data fields are required for template processing and ensure consistent placeholder usage across my template collection.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Placeholder Detection with OpenXML
- **GIVEN** a DOCX template file with placeholders
- **WHEN** the scan command is executed
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Use OpenXML SDK to parse document structure safely
  - Detect placeholders in document body, headers, and footers
  - Handle placeholders in tables, text boxes, and shapes
  - Support customizable placeholder patterns (default: `{{.*?}}`)
  - Extract placeholder text content accurately

### AC2: Split Text Run Handling
- **GIVEN** a template with placeholders split across multiple text runs
- **WHEN** scanning for placeholders
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Reconstruct complete placeholder text from fragmented runs
  - Handle formatting changes within placeholder boundaries
  - Detect placeholders that span multiple paragraphs
  - Maintain accurate position information for fragmented placeholders
  - Log warnings when placeholders appear malformed

### AC3: Pattern Support and Customization
- **GIVEN** different placeholder conventions in templates
- **WHEN** scan command is executed with pattern options
- **THEN** the system should support:
  - Default pattern: `{{placeholderName}}` with regex `{{.*?}}`
  - Custom regex patterns via --pattern parameter
  - Multiple pattern support (--pattern can be specified multiple times)
  - Case-sensitive and case-insensitive matching options
  - Pattern validation with helpful error messages

### AC4: Unique Placeholder Aggregation
- **GIVEN** templates with duplicate placeholders
- **WHEN** scan results are generated
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Aggregate identical placeholders into unique entries
  - Track all locations where each placeholder appears
  - Count total occurrences per placeholder
  - Report placeholders used across multiple document sections
  - Identify variations in similar placeholder names

### AC5: Parallel Scanning Performance
- **GIVEN** multiple template files to scan
- **WHEN** batch scanning is performed
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Process multiple files concurrently with configurable parallelism
  - Maintain thread safety for result aggregation
  - Provide progress reporting across parallel operations
  - Handle file access conflicts gracefully
  - Allow cancellation of long-running scan operations

### AC6: Comprehensive Output Formats
- **GIVEN** scan results are available
- **WHEN** different output formats are requested
- **THEN** the system should provide:
  - JSON format with structured placeholder data and locations
  - Text format with human-readable placeholder summary
  - CSV format for spreadsheet import with location details
  - Statistics summary showing placeholder usage patterns
  - Error report for any files that couldn't be processed

## Assumptions

1. **Document Format**: Only .docx files are supported (not .doc, .docm, or .dotx)
2. **OpenXML Structure**: Templates follow standard OpenXML document structure
3. **Placeholder Format**: Placeholders are text-based and use consistent delimiters
4. **Memory Constraints**: Individual documents fit comfortably in memory for processing
5. **File Access**: Files are not password-protected or have read restrictions
6. **Encoding**: Documents use standard UTF-8 or UTF-16 text encoding
7. **Document Integrity**: Templates are not corrupted or missing required components
8. **Performance**: Scanning 1000+ templates should complete within reasonable time

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- DocumentFormat.OpenXml SDK for document parsing
- System.Text.RegularExpressions for pattern matching
- Task Parallel Library for concurrent processing

### Internal Dependencies
- Core.Models.Placeholder and PlaceholderLocation domain models
- Core.Services.IPlaceholderScanService interface
- Infrastructure OpenXML document processing utilities
- Story 02.001 (Discover Command) for file enumeration integration

### Blocking Dependencies
- Story 01.002 (Core Models & Interfaces) must be completed
- OpenXML infrastructure components must be implemented

---

## Notes

### Technical Considerations
- OpenXML documents can have complex formatting that fragments text runs
- Regular expressions need careful escaping for user-provided patterns
- Large documents may require streaming parsing for memory efficiency
- Thread safety is critical for parallel processing scenarios
- Different document sections (body, headers, footers) require separate traversal

### Risk Mitigation
- Implement comprehensive OpenXML parsing error handling
- Add memory usage monitoring for large document processing
- Create extensive test suite with various document formatting scenarios
- Implement progress cancellation for user experience
- Add detailed logging for troubleshooting complex parsing issues

### Future Enhancements
- Support for placeholder validation against schema definitions
- Integration with template libraries for placeholder standardization
- Real-time scanning as templates are modified
- Machine learning for placeholder pattern detection
- Support for conditional placeholders and complex expressions
