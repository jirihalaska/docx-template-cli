**Story ID:** 02.003  
**Epic:** CLI Commands & Basic Operations  
**Created:** 2025-08-17  
**Status:** Draft

---

## Story

**As a** template administrator,  
**I want** a CLI command to copy template files to target directories with intelligent handling,  
**so that** I can efficiently distribute templates across environments while preserving directory structure and preventing accidental overwrites.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Basic Template Copying
- **GIVEN** source templates and a target directory
- **WHEN** the copy command is executed
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Copy all specified template files to the target location
  - Preserve file timestamps and metadata where possible
  - Maintain file permissions appropriate for the target system
  - Report successful and failed copy operations clearly
  - Handle network drives and remote directories

### AC2: Directory Structure Preservation
- **GIVEN** templates organized in a nested directory structure
- **WHEN** copying with structure preservation enabled
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Recreate the source directory hierarchy in the target location
  - Support relative and absolute path preservation modes
  - Allow flattening directory structure with --flatten option
  - Handle duplicate filenames when flattening with automatic renaming
  - Preserve empty directories when requested

### AC3: Overwrite Protection and Conflict Resolution
- **GIVEN** target files already exist at destination
- **WHEN** copy operation encounters conflicts
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Default to preventing overwrites and report conflicts
  - Support overwrite modes: skip, overwrite, prompt, rename
  - Generate unique filenames for rename mode (e.g., template_001.docx)
  - Provide --force flag for unconditional overwriting
  - Compare file sizes and timestamps for intelligent conflict detection

### AC4: Dry-Run Mode and Preview
- **GIVEN** a copy operation is planned
- **WHEN** dry-run mode is enabled (--dry-run flag)
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Show exactly what files would be copied without performing operations
  - Display target paths and potential conflicts
  - Calculate total disk space requirements
  - Validate target directory permissions and accessibility
  - Provide detailed operation summary without file modifications

### AC5: Advanced Copy Options
- **GIVEN** various copying requirements
- **WHEN** advanced options are specified
- **THEN** the system should support:
  - Selective copying with include/exclude patterns
  - Size-based filtering (--min-size, --max-size)
  - Date-based filtering (--newer-than, --older-than)
  - Verification mode to compare copied files with sources
  - Progress reporting for large copy operations
  - Parallel copying for improved performance on large sets

### AC6: Error Handling and Recovery
- **GIVEN** various error conditions during copying
- **WHEN** operations encounter problems
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Continue processing remaining files after individual failures
  - Provide detailed error messages for permission and disk space issues
  - Support resume functionality for interrupted operations
  - Generate comprehensive error logs for troubleshooting
  - Validate target directory writability before starting operations

## Assumptions

1. **File System Access**: User has write permissions to target directories
2. **Disk Space**: Sufficient space available for all copy operations
3. **File Locking**: Source files are not locked by other applications
4. **Network Reliability**: Network drives remain accessible during operations
5. **Concurrent Access**: Other processes may access files during copying
6. **Unicode Support**: File paths with international characters are supported
7. **Atomic Operations**: Individual file copies are atomic where supported
8. **Metadata Preservation**: Target file system supports source metadata

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- .NET file system APIs for cross-platform file operations
- System.IO for stream-based copying and verification

### Internal Dependencies
- Core.Services.ITemplateCopyService interface
- Infrastructure file system abstraction layer
- Story 02.001 (Discover Command) for source file enumeration
- Common progress reporting and cancellation infrastructure

### Blocking Dependencies
- Infrastructure foundation must support file operations
- Error handling framework must be established

---

## Notes

### Technical Considerations
- Large file copying may require chunked operations for memory efficiency
- Cross-platform file permissions and metadata handling varies significantly
- Network drive operations may be slower and require timeout handling
- Atomic operations may not be supported on all file systems
- File verification adds significant time but improves reliability

### Risk Mitigation
- Implement comprehensive pre-flight validation before copying
- Add atomic operation simulation where not natively supported
- Create detailed logging for all file operations and errors
- Implement retry logic for transient network errors
- Use checksums for file integrity verification when requested

### Future Enhancements
- Integration with cloud storage providers (Azure, AWS, Google Drive)
- Incremental copying based on file change detection
- Compression support for efficient network transfers
- Template transformation during copy operations
- Backup and restore capabilities for copy operations
