# User Story: Pipeline Support Implementation

**Story ID:** 03.002  
**Epic:** Advanced Features & Pipeline Support  
**Created:** 2025-08-17  
**Status:** Draft

---

## Story

**As a** DevOps engineer and automation developer,  
**I want** CLI commands that support Unix-style piping and JSON serialization for command chaining,  
**so that** I can create automated workflows and integrate template processing into CI/CD pipelines efficiently.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Stdin/Stdout Pipeline Support
- **GIVEN** CLI commands that need to work in pipeline workflows
- **WHEN** commands are executed with stdin input or stdout redirection
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Accept JSON input from stdin when no file parameters provided
  - Output structured JSON to stdout by default in pipeline mode
  - Support command chaining with pipe operators (|)
  - Handle empty stdin gracefully with appropriate error messages
  - Maintain consistent JSON schema across all commands

### AC2: JSON Serialization for Inter-Command Communication
- **GIVEN** output from one command needs to feed into another
- **WHEN** using JSON format for data transfer
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Provide consistent JSON schema with metadata (timestamp, success, data)
  - Support complex data structures (template sets, placeholder maps, file lists)
  - Include error information in failed operations JSON
  - Enable parsing of JSON input for downstream commands
  - Maintain backward compatibility with JSON schema versions

### AC3: Command Chaining Support
- **GIVEN** multiple template operations need to be performed in sequence
- **WHEN** commands are chained together in pipeline
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Support discover → scan → copy → replace workflow chains
  - Pass template set context between commands automatically
  - Enable selective filtering and transformation between commands
  - Provide early termination on errors with proper exit codes
  - Support conditional execution based on previous command results

### AC4: Error Propagation Through Pipeline
- **GIVEN** errors occurring in pipeline command chains
- **WHEN** any command in the chain encounters problems
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Propagate error status through pipeline with non-zero exit codes
  - Include detailed error information in JSON output
  - Support error recovery and continuation strategies
  - Provide comprehensive error logging for pipeline debugging
  - Maintain pipeline state for rollback scenarios

### AC5: Pipeline Integration Testing
- **GIVEN** complete pipeline workflows need validation
- **WHEN** testing end-to-end pipeline scenarios
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Support automated testing of command chains
  - Provide pipeline performance metrics and timing
  - Enable dry-run mode for complete pipeline validation
  - Support pipeline configuration files for complex workflows
  - Include sample pipeline scripts for common use cases

### AC6: CI/CD Integration Support
- **GIVEN** template processing needs to integrate with build systems
- **WHEN** used in automated deployment pipelines
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Support environment variable configuration for secrets
  - Provide machine-readable output for build system integration
  - Enable timeout handling for long-running pipeline operations
  - Support parallel pipeline execution for multiple template sets
  - Include Docker container compatibility for containerized builds

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- From stories 02.001-02.004: All commands support JSON output format
- From story 03.001: Error handling and progress reporting established
- Consistent command structure with System.CommandLine provides foundation

### Data Models
- **PipelineContext**: Value object containing shared state between commands [Source: architecture.md#domain-models]
- **PipelineResult**: Contains operation results and metadata for command chaining
- **CommandChainConfiguration**: Configuration for multi-command workflows

### API Specifications
- **PipelineProcessor**: Infrastructure service for stdin/stdout handling [Source: architecture.md#pipeline-pattern]
  - `ProcessAsync<T>(Stream input, ICommand<T> command, CancellationToken token)`
  - `SerializeResultAsync(object result, Stream output)`
  - `DeserializeInputAsync<T>(Stream input)`
- **CommandChain**: Orchestration service for workflow execution [Source: architecture.md#pipeline-pattern]
  - `ExecuteChainAsync(PipelineConfiguration config, CancellationToken token)`

### Component Specifications
- **Pipeline Infrastructure**: Command chaining support with JSON serialization [Source: architecture.md#cli-layer]
- **Output Formatters**: Strategy pattern implementation for JSON/Text/XML formats [Source: architecture.md#strategy-pattern]
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive pipeline error propagation [Source: architecture.md#error-handling-architecture]

### File Locations
- Pipeline processor: `DocxTemplate.CLI/Pipeline/PipelineProcessor.cs`
- Command chain: `DocxTemplate.CLI/Pipeline/CommandChain.cs`
- Pipeline configuration: `DocxTemplate.Core/Models/PipelineConfiguration.cs`
- Integration tests: `DocxTemplate.Integration.Tests/PipelineTests/`
- Sample configs: `examples/pipelines/`

### Testing Requirements
Based on testing-strategy.md from architecture:
- Integration tests for complete pipeline workflows
- Performance tests for pipeline overhead measurement
- Unit tests for JSON serialization/deserialization
- Cross-platform pipeline compatibility tests
- Error propagation and recovery scenario tests

### Technical Constraints
- Async/await pattern throughout pipeline operations [Source: architecture.md#adr-002]
- JSON schema compatibility with existing command outputs
- Unix-style pipeline conventions for cross-platform compatibility
- Memory-efficient streaming for large data sets in pipelines
- Cancellation token support throughout pipeline chain

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- **Test Location**: `DocxTemplate.Integration.Tests/PipelineTests/` for pipeline tests, `DocxTemplate.CLI.Tests/Pipeline/` for unit tests
- **Framework**: XUnit with pipeline testing utilities and real process execution
- **Coverage**: Integration test coverage for all command combinations in pipeline
- **Patterns**: End-to-end testing with actual stdin/stdout, mock external dependencies
- **Performance**: Pipeline overhead measurement and timeout handling validation

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Complete workflow testing: list-sets → discover → scan → copy → replace
- JSON schema validation across all command outputs
- Error propagation and exit code validation in pipeline chains
