# User Story: Error Handling and Recovery Implementation

**Story ID:** 03.003  
**Epic:** Advanced Features & Pipeline Support  
**Created:** 2025-08-17  
**Status:** Done

---

## Story

**As a** system administrator and template processor user,  
**I want** clear error messages and basic error handling for template processing operations,  
**so that** I can quickly identify and resolve issues when operations fail.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Basic Error Detection and User-Friendly Messages
- **GIVEN** various error conditions during template processing
- **WHEN** errors occur in any operation (discover, scan, copy, replace)
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Detect common error types (file not found, access denied, corrupt files)
  - Provide clear, actionable error messages with file paths and operation context
  - Return appropriate exit codes (0 for success, non-zero for failures)
  - Include basic error information (what failed, where, why)
  - Handle exceptions gracefully without application crashes

### AC2: Pipeline Error Propagation
- **GIVEN** errors occurring in command pipeline workflows
- **WHEN** pipeline operations encounter failures
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Propagate errors through pipeline chains with appropriate exit codes
  - Stop pipeline execution on critical failures (fail-fast)
  - Include error information in JSON output for pipeline processing
  - Provide clear error messages for pipeline debugging
  - Maintain consistent error format across all commands

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- From stories 02.001-03.002: Basic error handling established in CLI commands
- From story 03.001: Backup and atomic operations foundation available
- From story 03.002: Pipeline error propagation requirements defined

### Data Models
- **ErrorResult**: Simple value object containing error type, message, and context
- **CommandResult**: Contains success/failure status with error details for pipeline operations
- **ValidationResult**: Basic validation with error messages [Source: architecture.md#domain-models]

### API Specifications
- **IErrorHandler**: Basic error handling service
  - `HandleExceptionAsync(Exception exception, string operationContext)`
  - `FormatErrorMessage(Exception exception, string context)`
  - `GetExitCode(Exception exception)`
- **Command Classes**: Each command handles its own errors with consistent patterns
  - Error detection and user-friendly message formatting
  - Exit code management for CLI operations

### Component Specifications
- **Simple Exception Hierarchy**: Basic exceptions for common scenarios [Source: architecture.md#error-handling-architecture]
  - DomainException, InfrastructureException, CommandException
- **Error Message Formatting**: Consistent, user-friendly error messages
- **Exit Code Management**: Standard CLI exit codes for automation

### File Locations
- Error handling: `DocxTemplate.Core/ErrorHandling/IErrorHandler.cs`
- Exception hierarchy: `DocxTemplate.Core/Exceptions/`
- Command error handling: Integrated into each command class
- Error formatting utilities: `DocxTemplate.CLI/ErrorFormatting/`

### Testing Requirements
Based on testing-strategy.md from architecture:
- Unit tests for common error scenarios (file not found, access denied)
- Integration tests for pipeline error propagation
- Error message clarity validation
- Exit code correctness testing

### Technical Constraints
- Simple error handling without complex dependencies
- Clear, actionable error messages for users
- Consistent error format across all commands
- Pipeline-compatible error propagation

---

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- **Test Location**: `DocxTemplate.Core.Tests/ErrorHandling/` for core tests, `DocxTemplate.Infrastructure.Tests/Recovery/` for infrastructure tests
- **Framework**: XUnit with error injection testing utilities and Polly test extensions
- **Coverage**: 100% coverage for error paths and recovery scenarios
- **Patterns**: Fault injection testing, chaos engineering principles, arrange-act-assert with error validation
- **Performance**: Error handling overhead measurement and recovery time validation

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Comprehensive error scenario testing (file corruption, access denied, network failures)
- Transaction rollback validation with file system verification
- Pipeline error propagation and recovery in command chains
- Retry logic validation with exponential backoff timing
- Cross-platform error handling consistency testing
