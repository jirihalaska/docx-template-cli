## Story

**As a** system administrator and template processor user,  
**I want** comprehensive error handling with automatic recovery and detailed error reporting,  
**so that** I can quickly identify and resolve issues while maintaining data integrity during template processing operations.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Comprehensive Error Detection and Classification
- **GIVEN** various error conditions during template processing
- **WHEN** errors occur in any operation (discover, scan, copy, replace)
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Detect and classify errors by type (file access, corruption, validation, network)
  - Provide specific error codes for automated handling
  - Include detailed context information (file paths, operation stage, parameters)
  - Distinguish between recoverable and non-recoverable errors
  - Generate structured error objects with metadata for troubleshooting

### AC2: Transaction Support for Operations
- **GIVEN** multi-file operations that need atomicity
- **WHEN** any operation fails during batch processing
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Support transactional operations with rollback capability
  - Create checkpoints before destructive operations
  - Provide automatic rollback on critical failures
  - Maintain operation logs for manual recovery scenarios
  - Support partial completion with resume functionality

### AC3: Rollback Mechanisms
- **GIVEN** failed operations requiring restoration
- **WHEN** rollback is initiated (automatic or manual)
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Restore all modified files to pre-operation state
  - Clean up temporary and intermediate files
  - Restore directory structures and permissions
  - Provide rollback status reporting with verification
  - Support selective rollback for specific operations or files

### AC4: Detailed Error Reporting
- **GIVEN** errors requiring user intervention or troubleshooting
- **WHEN** generating error reports
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Create comprehensive error logs with timestamps and correlation IDs
  - Include full operation context (parameters, file paths, system state)
  - Provide actionable error messages with suggested resolutions
  - Generate both human-readable and machine-parseable error formats
  - Support error report export for support and debugging scenarios

### AC5: Recovery Strategies
- **GIVEN** transient errors and recoverable failures
- **WHEN** implementing recovery mechanisms
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
  - Support circuit breaker pattern for external service calls
  - Provide graceful degradation for non-critical features
  - Enable manual recovery workflows for complex scenarios
  - Support resume operations from last successful checkpoint

### AC6: Error Handling in Pipeline Operations
- **GIVEN** errors occurring in command pipeline workflows
- **WHEN** pipeline operations encounter failures
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Propagate errors appropriately through pipeline chains
  - Support error handling strategies (fail-fast, continue-on-error, retry)
  - Provide pipeline-wide rollback for critical operation chains
  - Generate pipeline error summaries with individual command status
  - Enable conditional pipeline execution based on error types

### Previous Story Insights
- From stories 02.001-03.002: Basic error handling established in CLI commands
- From story 03.001: Backup and atomic operations foundation available
- From story 03.002: Pipeline error propagation requirements defined

### Data Models
- **ErrorContext**: Value object containing error metadata and context [Source: architecture.md#domain-models]
- **TransactionContext**: Manages operation state and rollback information
- **RecoveryStrategy**: Configuration for retry and recovery behavior
- **ValidationResult**: Extended with error classification and recovery guidance [Source: architecture.md#domain-models]

### API Specifications
- **IErrorHandlingService**: Core service for error management [Source: architecture.md#error-handling-architecture]
  - `ClassifyErrorAsync(Exception error, OperationContext context)`
  - `CreateRecoveryPlanAsync(ErrorContext error)`
  - `ExecuteRecoveryAsync(RecoveryPlan plan, CancellationToken token)`
- **ITransactionService**: Service for operation transactions
  - `BeginTransactionAsync(OperationScope scope)`
  - `CreateCheckpointAsync(string checkpointId)`

### File Locations
- Error handling service: `DocxTemplate.Core/Services/IErrorHandlingService.cs`

### Testing Requirements
Based on testing-strategy.md from architecture:
- Unit tests for all error classification scenarios
- Integration tests for transaction and rollback functionality
- Chaos engineering tests for resilience validation
- Performance tests for error handling overhead
- Recovery time objective (RTO) measurement tests

### Technical Constraints
