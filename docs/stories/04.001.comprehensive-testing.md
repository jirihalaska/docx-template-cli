# User Story: Comprehensive Testing Implementation

**Story ID:** 04.001  
**Epic:** Testing, Documentation & Release  
**Created:** 2025-08-17  
**Status:** Draft

---

## Story

**As a** quality assurance engineer and development team lead,  
**I want** comprehensive test coverage including unit, integration, performance, and cross-platform tests,  
**so that** I can ensure system reliability, performance compliance, and quality standards before production release.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Unit Test Coverage Achievement (>90%)
- **GIVEN** all core services and CLI components
- **WHEN** running unit test suite
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Achieve minimum 90% code coverage across all projects
  - Cover all public API methods and critical internal logic
  - Include comprehensive edge case and error condition testing
  - Provide fast execution with complete test suite running under 30 seconds
  - Generate detailed coverage reports with uncovered line identification

### AC2: Cross-Platform Testing (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- **GIVEN** multi-platform deployment targets
- **WHEN** running tests on different operating systems
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Execute identical test suites on Windows, macOS, and Linux
  - Validate file path handling and directory operations across platforms
  - Test Unicode and Czech character handling on all platforms
  - Verify CLI behavior consistency across different shells
  - Include platform-specific file permission and metadata testing

### AC3: Automated Test Infrastructure
- **GIVEN** continuous integration and development workflow needs
- **WHEN** implementing test automation
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Integrate all test suites with CI/CD pipeline
  - Provide test result reporting and failure notifications
  - Support parallel test execution for faster feedback
  - Include test data management and cleanup automation
  - Enable developer-friendly local test execution

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- From stories 01.001-03.003: Basic unit testing framework established
- From story 03.002: Pipeline testing requirements defined
- From story 03.003: Error handling test scenarios identified
- Note: End-to-end testing separated to story 04.002

### Data Models
- **TestContext**: Value object containing test execution metadata
- **TestDataSet**: Standardized test documents and scenarios

### API Specifications
- **ITestDataManager**: Service for test data lifecycle management
  - `CreateTestDataSetAsync(TestScenario scenario)`
  - `CleanupTestDataAsync(TestContext context)`
  - `GenerateTestDocumentsAsync(int count, DocumentType type)`

### Component Specifications
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive test utilities and fixtures [Source: architecture.md#testing-architecture]
- **XUnit Test Framework**: Primary testing framework with parallel execution [Source: architecture.md#testing-architecture]

### File Locations
- Unit tests: `DocxTemplate.*.Tests/` following project structure
- Integration tests: `DocxTemplate.Integration.Tests/`
- Test utilities: `DocxTemplate.TestUtilities/`
- Test data: `tests/data/` with version control

### Testing Requirements
Based on testing-strategy.md from architecture:
- XUnit framework with >90% coverage requirement [Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- Cross-platform CI/CD pipeline validation
- Integration testing for complete user workflows

### Technical Constraints
- GitHub Actions for cross-platform CI/CD execution
- Real Word documents for integration testing (not mocked)
- Parallel test execution without resource conflicts

---

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- **Test Location**: Organized by test type with clear naming conventions
- **Framework**: XUnit primary with custom utilities for integration
- **Coverage**: >90% unit test coverage, 100% public API coverage
- **Patterns**: AAA pattern, proper test isolation, realistic test data
- **Performance**: Complete test suite execution under 3 minutes in CI/CD

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Czech character preservation validation across all platforms
- Pipeline operation testing with real stdin/stdout
- Error injection testing for all failure scenarios
