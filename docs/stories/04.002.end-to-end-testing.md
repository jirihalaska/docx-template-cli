## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- From stories 01.001-03.003: All individual components and commands implemented
- From story 04.001: Unit testing framework and coverage infrastructure established
- Need real-world validation of complete system integration

### Data Models
- **WorkflowTestContext**: Contains complete workflow state and validation data
- **DocumentTestSet**: Standardized test documents with expected outcomes
- **IntegrationTestResult**: Comprehensive results from end-to-end test execution

### API Specifications
- **IWorkflowTestManager**: Service for end-to-end workflow testing
  - `ExecuteWorkflowAsync(WorkflowScenario scenario, CancellationToken token)`
  - `ValidateWorkflowResultAsync(WorkflowResult result, ExpectedOutcome expected)`
  - `CreateTestEnvironmentAsync(TestEnvironmentSpec spec)`
- **IDocumentValidator**: Service for document integrity validation
  - `ValidateDocumentIntegrityAsync(string originalPath, string processedPath)`
  - `ValidateCharacterPreservationAsync(string documentPath, Encoding encoding)`

### Component Specifications
- **End-to-End Testing Infrastructure**: Real process execution and validation [Source: architecture.md#testing-architecture]
- **Document Processing Validation**: OpenXML-based integrity checking
- **Command Integration Testing**: JSON output validation and command chaining

### File Locations
- E2E tests: `DocxTemplate.EndToEnd.Tests/`

- Test documents: `tests/data/e2e-documents/`
- Integration utilities: `DocxTemplate.EndToEnd.Tests/Utilities/`
- Test environments: `tests/environments/`

### Testing Requirements
Based on testing-strategy.md from architecture:
- Real process execution (not in-memory testing)
- Comprehensive document validation with real .docx files
- Cross-platform workflow validation
- Performance validation within end-to-end scenarios
- Complete user journey validation from start to finish

### Technical Constraints
- Real .docx documents required (no mocking for document processing)
- Cross-platform test execution consistency
- Resource cleanup and test isolation
- Large test data management and version control
- Performance testing integration within workflows

### Technical Implementation Strategy

**Compiled CLI Testing Approach**:
- Test actual compiled executables (`docx-template.exe`), not in-memory code
- Real process execution with separate process launches
- Cross-platform native executable testing (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- JSON output validation and command interaction testing

**Technology Stack**:
- **Primary Framework**: XUnit with custom E2E testing utilities
- **Process Execution**: System.Diagnostics.Process for real CLI invocation
- **Document Validation**: OpenXML SDK for integrity checking
- **Command Interaction Testing**: JSON output validation between commands

**Example E2E Test Structure**:
```csharp
[Fact] 
public async Task CompleteWorkflow_ProcessesTemplateSet()
{
    // arrange - real executable and test documents
    var executable = GetCompiledExecutable();
    var testTemplates = PrepareRealDocxFiles();
    
    // act - execute real CLI commands
    var listResult = await ExecuteCliAsync("list-sets --templates ./test-data");
    var discoverResult = await ExecuteCliAsync("discover --set Contract_Templates");
    var copyResult = await ExecuteCliAsync("copy --target ./output");
    var replaceResult = await ExecuteCliAsync("replace --map values.json");
    
    // assert - validate real file outputs
    AssertDocumentIntegrity(originalDocs, processedDocs);
    AssertCzechCharacterPreservation(processedDocs);
}
```

**Key Technical Components**:
- **CliProcessExecutor**: Real process execution with timeout handling
- **DocumentIntegrityValidator**: OpenXML document comparison and validation
- **CommandChainTestManager**: Command interaction with JSON output validation
- **TestEnvironmentProvisioner**: Automated test data and environment setup

**Multi-Level Validation Strategy**:
1. **Exit Codes**: Process success/failure validation
2. **JSON Output**: Schema validation for pipeline compatibility  
3. **File Integrity**: OpenXML document structure validation
4. **Character Preservation**: Unicode/Czech text validation
5. **Performance**: Real-world timing and memory usage measurement

**Error Scenario Testing**:
- Corrupt document handling with real corrupted files
- Permission failures on actual file system
- Network drive scenarios with mounted drives
- Resource exhaustion with large document sets
