  - FAQ section covering common user questions
  - Error message explanations with resolution steps
  - Performance troubleshooting and optimization guidance
  - Platform-specific issues and solutions

### AC5: Architecture Documentation and Diagrams
- **GIVEN** system design and technical architecture
- **WHEN** developers need to understand or extend the system
- **THEN** the documentation should include:
  - High-level architecture overview with visual diagrams
  - Component interaction diagrams and data flow
  - Design pattern explanations and implementation rationale
  - Extension points and customization guidelines
  - Development environment setup and contribution guide

### AC6: Installation and Deployment Documentation
- **GIVEN** various deployment scenarios and environments
- **WHEN** users need to install or deploy the system
- **THEN** the documentation should provide:
  - Installation instructions for all supported platforms
  - Deployment guide for enterprise environments
  - Configuration options and environment variables

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- From all previous stories: Complete system functionality and architecture established
- From story 04.001: Testing requirements and scenarios available for documentation
- Rich command set and pipeline capabilities need comprehensive documentation

### Data Models
- **DocumentationStructure**: Organization of documentation hierarchy and navigation
- **ExampleScenario**: Standardized examples and use cases for documentation
- **ConfigurationSchema**: Documentation of all configuration options and settings

### API Specifications
- **DocFX Configuration**: Project configuration for API documentation generation
- **Markdown Templates**: Standardized templates for consistent documentation format
- **Example Data Sets**: Real sample data for documentation examples

### Component Specifications
- **DocFX Integration**: API documentation generation from XML comments [Source: architecture.md#technical-constraints]
- **Documentation Site**: Static site generation with search and navigation
- **Diagram Generation**: Architecture diagrams with Mermaid or similar tools

### File Locations
