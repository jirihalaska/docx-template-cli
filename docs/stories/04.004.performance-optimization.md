  - Balance CPU and I/O bound work appropriately

### AC6: Performance Monitoring and Profiling
- **GIVEN** need for performance analysis and optimization validation
- **WHEN** measuring system performance
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Include built-in performance counters and metrics collection
