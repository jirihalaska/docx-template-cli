**Story ID:** 04.005  
**Epic:** Testing, Documentation & Release  
**Created:** 2025-08-17  
**Status:** Draft

---

## Story

**As a** DevOps engineer and release manager,  
**I want** automated release builds, distribution packages, and deployment artifacts for all supported platforms,  
**so that** I can deliver a production-ready v2.0.0 release with professional deployment and installation experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Cross-Platform Release Builds
- **GIVEN** source code ready for production release
- **WHEN** generating release builds
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Create self-contained executables for Windows (win-x64), macOS (osx-x64), and Linux (linux-x64)
  - Generate framework-dependent portable builds for .NET 8.0 environments
  - Include all required dependencies and libraries in self-contained builds
  - Optimize builds for size and performance (ReadyToRun, trimming where applicable)
  - Ensure builds are reproducible with consistent checksums

### AC2: Checksum Generation and Security
- **GIVEN** release binaries and distribution packages
- **WHEN** preparing for distribution
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Generate SHA256 checksums for all binary artifacts
  - Create detached signature files for integrity verification
  - Include checksum validation in installation scripts
  - Provide public key for signature verification
  - Generate SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) for security compliance

### AC3: Installation Scripts and Distribution
- **GIVEN** various deployment scenarios and user environments
- **WHEN** creating installation packages
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Create PowerShell installation script for Windows with elevation handling
  - Generate shell script installer for macOS and Linux with dependency checking
  - Support both system-wide and user-local installation options
  - Include uninstall scripts and procedures
  - Provide package manager integration (Chocolatey, Homebrew, APT) preparation

### AC4: Release Notes and Documentation
- **GIVEN** features, fixes, and changes in v2.0.0
- **WHEN** preparing release documentation
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Generate comprehensive release notes with categorized changes
  - Include migration guide from v1.0 Python implementation
  - Document breaking changes and compatibility considerations
  - Provide upgrade instructions and rollback procedures
  - Include performance improvements and benchmark comparisons

### AC5: Version Tagging and Git Management
- **GIVEN** source code repository and release workflow
- **WHEN** finalizing release preparation
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Create git tag for v2.0.0 with semantic versioning
  - Generate release branch with appropriate commit history
  - Include comprehensive commit history and contributor acknowledgments
  - Update version numbers across all project files consistently
  - Create GitHub release with proper asset organization

### AC6: Quality Assurance and Release Validation
- **GIVEN** completed release artifacts and packages
- **WHEN** validating release readiness
- **THEN** the system should:
  - Execute complete test suite on all release builds
  - Validate installation and functionality on clean environments
  - Test upgrade scenarios from previous versions
  - Verify all documentation links and references
  - Confirm security scanning and vulnerability assessment completion
