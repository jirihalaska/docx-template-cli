# Story 05.001: Placeholder Ordering Enhancement

## User Story
As a **GUI application developer**,
I want **the scan command to preserve placeholder discovery order in JSON output**,
So that **placeholders appear in logical sequence for user input**.

## Context
The GUI requires placeholders to be displayed in the same order they appear in the document templates. Currently, the scan command JSON output doesn't guarantee ordering.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `scan --format json` returns placeholders in document discovery order
2. Placeholder ordering is preserved from first occurrence in templates
3. Existing JSON structure remains unchanged (backward compatible)

## Technical Approach
- Modify placeholder collection to maintain insertion order during scanning
- Ensure JSON serialization preserves this order
- No changes to core service interfaces required

## Definition of Done
- [x] Placeholders returned in discovery order via JSON
- [x] Existing scan functionality unchanged
- [x] Tests verify ordering behavior
- [x] No breaking changes to JSON format
