# Story 07.002: End-to-End Integration Testing

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** quality assurance engineer,  
**I want** comprehensive end-to-end tests that prove GUI-CLI integration works correctly,  
**so that** we can confidently release the integrated system knowing it works as expected.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. At least 1 automated E2E test proving GUI-CLI integration works end-to-end
2. E2E test covers complete happy path: template selection → placeholder scanning → value input → processing → verification
3. E2E test verifies actual file outputs match expected results
4. E2E test runs in CI/CD pipeline on both Windows and macOS
5. E2E test includes both GUI automation and CLI command verification
6. E2E test validates that GUI produces same results as direct CLI usage
7. E2E test framework supports multiple test scenarios and edge cases

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Set up GUI automation testing framework (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Research and implement Avalonia UI automation library
  - [ ] Create base test classes for GUI interaction
  - [ ] Implement page object pattern for wizard steps
- [ ] Create happy path E2E test (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Test template set selection (Step 1)
  - [ ] Test placeholder discovery and display (Step 2)
  - [ ] Test placeholder value input (Step 3)
  - [ ] Test output folder selection (Step 4)
  - [ ] Test processing and results (Step 5)
  - [ ] Verify generated files contain expected content
- [ ] Add CLI command verification within E2E tests (AC: 5, 6)
  - [ ] Capture CLI commands executed during GUI test
  - [ ] Execute same commands directly via CLI
  - [ ] Compare GUI results with direct CLI results
  - [ ] Ensure 100% result parity
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline integration (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Configure E2E tests to run on Windows build agents
  - [ ] Configure E2E tests to run on macOS build agents  
  - [ ] Add test artifacts collection (screenshots, logs, output files)
  - [ ] Configure test failure notifications
- [ ] Create additional test scenarios (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Error handling tests (missing templates, invalid values)
  - [ ] Edge cases (special characters, large file sets)
  - [ ] Performance tests (processing time verification)
  - [ ] Recovery tests (CLI crashes, timeouts)

## Dev Notes
### Architecture Context
- E2E tests located in `DocxTemplate.Tests/E2E/` project
- Uses GUI automation framework compatible with Avalonia UI
- Tests must work with self-contained executables (no development environment)
- Test data includes sample templates with known placeholders and expected outputs

### Required Test Infrastructure
- Sample template sets for testing in `DocxTemplate.Tests/TestData/Templates/`
- Expected output files for comparison in `DocxTemplate.Tests/TestData/Expected/`
- JSON placeholder value files for testing in `DocxTemplate.Tests/TestData/Values/`
- GUI automation helpers for wizard navigation

### Testing Standards
- E2E tests in `DocxTemplate.Tests/E2E/` using XUnit framework
- Use arrange, act, assert pattern with clear test phases
- Each test must clean up temporary files and folders
- Tests must be repeatable and not interfere with each other
- Capture screenshots on test failures for debugging
