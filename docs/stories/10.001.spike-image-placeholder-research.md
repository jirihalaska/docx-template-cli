# Story 1: Research Spike - Image Placeholder Support

## Story Title
**SPIKE: Research Image Placeholder Implementation** - Technical Investigation

## User Story
As a **development team**,  
I want **to research and prototype image placeholder functionality for DOCX templates**,  
So that **we can make informed technical decisions for the implementation**.

## Research Objectives

### Core Questions to Answer
1. How to insert and size images in DOCX using DocumentFormat.OpenXml?
2. Can we use a graphical element defining the size and insert the image with auto fit function?
3. What's the best image processing library for cross-platform .NET 9?
4. What placeholder syntax best fits our existing pattern?
5. How to handle image boundaries and aspect ratios in Word?

## Acceptance Criteria

### Research Deliverables
1. Proposed placeholder syntax with examples
2. Technical design document with recommended approach
3. List of required NuGet packages and their licenses

## Tasks Checklist

### DocumentFormat.OpenXml Research
- [x] Investigate image insertion APIs
- [x] Understand image sizing/boundary mechanisms
- [x] Test inline vs floating image options
- [x] Document image format support (PNG, JPEG, etc.)

### Image Processing Library Evaluation
- [x] Evaluate ImageSharp for .NET 9 compatibility
- [x] Test SkiaSharp cross-platform support
- [x] Benchmark System.Drawing.Common alternatives
- [x] Compare memory usage and performance

### Placeholder Syntax Design
- [x] Design syntax compatible with existing `{{.*?}}` pattern
- [x] Consider parameters: width, height, fit mode
- [x] Create examples for different use cases
- [x] Ensure backward compatibility

### Prototype Development
- [x] Create minimal POC for image insertion
- [x] Test image resizing with chosen library
- [x] Verify cross-platform functionality
- [x] Measure performance impact

## Definition of Done
- [x] POC code demonstrates image insertion
- [x] Image resizing tested on all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [x] Syntax proposal reviewed and approved
- [x] Technical risks identified and documented
- [x] Implementation estimate provided

## Timebox
**4 hours maximum**

## Notes
- Focus on practical implementation approach
- Prioritize cross-platform compatibility
- Consider deployment size impact
- Document any licensing concerns
